Optimal transport (OT) distance, known as the
Earth Moverâ€™s distance, is a classic metric that plays a fundamental role in the probability simplex. 
Compared with Kullback-Leibler or Jensen-Shannon divergence, OT
distance is the unique one that needs to be parameterized.
Though the support sets of two distributions do not overlap with each other, the OT distance can still measure the
relation between the distributions. \cite{LiMengXue9157821}
